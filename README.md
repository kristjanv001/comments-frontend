## 📝 Description

This is mock comments component - a small demo app built with Angular. The comment card layout relies heavily on css grid as the layout changes quite a bit depending on the screen size.

Voting works similarly to Reddit's - users can only leave a single vote and the vote resets back to its original value if the method receives the same vote type.
